# File Organizer

Intelligently organize files and folders by understanding context, finding duplicates, and suggesting better structures.

## When to Use
- Cleaning up messy directories (Downloads, Desktop, etc.)
- Finding and removing duplicate files
- Restructuring project directories
- Archiving old projects

## Process
1. Analyze current structure (file types, sizes, dates)
2. Identify patterns and groupings
3. Find duplicates (by hash, name, or size)
4. Propose organization plan with clear before/after
5. Execute with user approval — always confirm before deleting
6. Provide maintenance tips

## Organization Strategies
- **By type**: Documents, Images, Videos, Archives, Code
- **By purpose**: Work vs Personal, Active vs Archive
- **By date**: Year/Month structure for photos and documents

## Rules
- Always ask before deleting anything
- Preserve original modification dates
- Log all moves for potential undo
- Handle filename conflicts gracefully
