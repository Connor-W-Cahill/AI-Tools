# AI Shared Context

This file is automatically updated by the AI orchestration system.
All AI tools (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Amp) can read and contribute to this context.

## How to Use

1. **Before starting work**: Check `aio status` to see who's working on what
2. **Claim your work area**: Use `aio claim file <path>` or `aio claim directory <path>`
3. **Share learnings**: Use `aio-context learning "your insight"`
4. **Hand off work**: Use `aio-context handoff "what to know"`

## Active Work

Run `aio status` to see current AI instances and their claims.
